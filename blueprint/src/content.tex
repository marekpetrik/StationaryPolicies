\section{Stochastic Processes}

For the sake of keeping things simple initially, we define our own finite probability space. The probability space will capture the distributions over histories, states, and actions. We will also construct cross products of probability spaces. The medium-term goal is to eliminate these definitions and results and instead build on the measure theory components built into lean.



\section{Histories}

In this section, we capture the stochastic process using a distribution over histories.

\section{History-Dependent DP}

Here, we derive dynamic programming equations for histories.

\section{Markov Value Functions}


\section{Markov Policies}
